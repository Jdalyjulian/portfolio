                    <p class="mb-5 text-muted"> Students learned about the balance of ecosystems and how matter is cycled through an ecosystem. Students first manipulated a virtual simulation with elodea and snails and discovered the ideal conditions for each organism to remain living. Students then applied this information and created their own biosphere bottle model. After approving the models, students were allowed to create biosphere bottles. The major cycles students focused on included the producer/consumer gas exchange, as well as the cycling of energy and nutrients up a food chain and the return of these nutrients to the producers by decomposers.</p>

                    <p class="mb-5 text-muted"> Students are taking on the role of a medical professional and are learning about the human body systems through case based learning. Students were first presented with a patient and symptoms. They mapped the symptoms out and determined where to start the meidcal investigation. During this process, students are learning how all of the body systems interact with one another, as well as the relationship between body systems and cells.</p>

                    <p class="mb-5 text-muted"> Tropisms are when a plant responds to a stimuli. When plants grow towards sunlight, they are displaying phototropism. Plant mazes are an enclosed box with a hole at the top. Inside the box there are obstacles the plant must grow around to reach the sunlight. Plant mazes are an opportunity for students to make the stimulus-response connection outside of the human body.</p>
